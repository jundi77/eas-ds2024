The edgeshark docker compose file is taken from https://github.com/siemens/edgeshark/blob/main/deployments/wget/docker-compose-localhost.yaml.

On debian, using docker-ce (regular installation with docker official guide), this fails to start.


But tested on ubuntu and debian with docker-desktop, resulting in this edgeshark succesfully start. I don't know what happens, but make sure you are using docker-desktop for now. I am not responsible for this, if you want you can create issue to siemens repo mentioned above.
